# Landing Page Project

## **Overview**

The project in its entirety is a single page site that features a dynamic nav menu which programmatically generates based on the names and amount of sections on the page.

The page is also designed to hightlight the active section from within the nav menu while also adding an *active* class to the section element. A button is fixed to the bottom, right corner of the page allowing the user to scroll to the top of the page. Lastly, the page is responsive and features a hamburger button when viewing on screen sizes 767px or smaller.
